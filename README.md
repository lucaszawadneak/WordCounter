## :abcd: Word Counter

This is an [Angular](https://angular.io/) Word Counter that was developed during my [TuntsCord](http://www.tuntscorp.com/) internship! It's a fairly simple page, where you can set a limit to the number of words you want to write.
This web app is in Brazillian Portuguese.

You can check it out [**here**](https://lucaszawadneak.github.io/wordcounter/) :smiley:
